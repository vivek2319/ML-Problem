combo of glm(lasso)+pcr gave us 79 rank 
glm lasso + elastic _ pcr = 84
only plsr gave us 0.44
glm lasso + pcr + plsr = 0.4380
only pcr gave us = 0.4378 150 rank 
{
did scale and then used glm standardize false + pcr 
glm standardize true ncomp = 1 
glm standardize true ncomp = 3
} Nothing worked 

knnreg + glmnet ridge + pcr = 96
nusta lda without prior 0.4714
fakta lasso = 0.4389
fakta ridge = 0.4371
nusta lda with prior = 0.6794
nusta svm = 0.6794

so far normalization and then standardization in glm(lasso)+pcr is the best 

glm ridge + PCR = gave us 0.4323 79th rank wow!
